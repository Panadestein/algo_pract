* Instructions to create CHAMP workflow

** Steps

*** DONE Create repository in TREX's GitHub

*** TODO Create git submodule

    #+begin_src shell
    git submodule add https://github.com/filippi-claudia/champ.git
    #+end_src

*** TODO Create CHAMP example input and output to the repository

    We could also upload a tarball with the example (CN3?)

*** TODO Include compilation instructions in README.md

    This one is easy, we could use the same of CHAMP

** Comments

   To be able to clone a repository that contains submodules we use an
extra flag

   #+begin_src shell
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TREX-CoE/workload_champ
   #+end_src

   I believe we will use this only for testing.
