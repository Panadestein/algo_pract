Adding new content quick startup
================================

Welcome to the source code of the Wiki of the Golze Group. These project uses `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ to authomatically generate the documentation. As such, new content is added in the `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ markup language. Here are two ways in which you could contribute to this wiki.

The standard way
----------------

If you clone the repo to edit files locally you will need the Sphinx Python 3 module to be able to compile the html (or alternatively latex) files. You can intall Sphinx with **pip**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -U sphinx


More information on installing Sphinx `here <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>`_.

Create the new documentation files (*e.g.* newdoc.rst) inside the **source** directory. Then modify the file **source/index.rst** to add the new documentation file without the extension:

.. code-block:: rest

    toctree::
       :maxdepth: 2
       :caption: Contents
       :titlesonly:
   
       fhi_aims
       general_tud
       newdoc

After editing, compile to HTML with:

.. code-block:: bash

   make html


You can preview the compilation results with the Python 3 builtin module `http.server <https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html>`_. The simplest usage of this module is:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd build/html
    python -m http.server

which runs a local server in the default address **0.0.0.0:8000**.

The quick and dirty way
-----------------------

In alternative to the previous procedure, one could simply add new .rst files in the **source** directory and preview them in the GitLab web interface, which renders the reStructuredText by default. In this case, you will also need to edit the **source/index.rst** and add the name of the new documentation file.
