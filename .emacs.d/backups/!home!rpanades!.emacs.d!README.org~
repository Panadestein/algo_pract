* Simple Emacs config

  This is my =$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el=. I have a very basic config,
  fine tuned for Python, C and FORTRAN development. It can be extended /ad infinitum/,
  as usual in Emacs (see for instance [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhyUseEmacs][this]]).

* Useful tweaks

  I use Emacs in an *Arch Linux* box, with *Gnome* as desktop environment. I think the
  systemd unit is the way to go here. It speeds up the startup process af the heavy config
  file is uploaded only once. This is greatly explained
