FHI-AIMS
========

Here you will find information regarding different aspects of the FHI-AIMS software package.

Obtaining FHI-AIMS
------------------

The group leader holds a licence. You can download the latest release yourself. Please register for the `aimsclub <https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/club_register.php>`_. In the field ``aimsclub-userid of the FHI-aims license holder`` write simply ``golze``.

.. Note::
   After registration you should also get an invitation to the gitlab and slack by Sebastian Kokott a day later. If not, please contact the group leader.

Compiling FHI-AIMS
------------------

How to compile FHI-AIMS in different machines.

Taurus
^^^^^^

As you might have seen, Taurus has many partitions. In the following are the instructions for **the haswell partition** (intel CPUs). Note, simply using this on romeo (AMD) would be not a good idea (intel software leads usually to errors/bad behavior there).

.. important::
   Compilation is best done under the workspace in scratch. Please check `this link <https://hpc-wiki.zih.tu-dresden.de/hpc-wiki/bin/view/Compendium/WorkSpaces>`_ as well as the general wiki of `the ZIH <https://hpc-wiki.zih.tu-dresden.de/hpc-wiki/bin/view/Compendium>`_ for more information.

* Load the following modules:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   module load modenv/scs5 intel/2019b

* Select a haswell node to use interactively:

.. code-block:: bash

   srun --ntasks=24 --cpus-per-task=1 --time=01:00:00 --mem-per-cpu=1800MB --partition=haswell --pty bash

This should send you to a haswell64; you can also check with ``echo $SLURM_JOB_PARTITION``.
