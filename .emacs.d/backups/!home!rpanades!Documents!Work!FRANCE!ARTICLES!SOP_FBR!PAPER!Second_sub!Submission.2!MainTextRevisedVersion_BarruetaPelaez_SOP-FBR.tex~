\begin{abstract}
The SOP-FBR approach for the automated multidimensional fit of potential energy surfaces (PES) is presented.
In its current implementation the method yields a PES in the so-called Tucker sum-of-products form but it is not restricted to this specific \emph{ansatz}.
The novelty of our algorithm lies in the fact that the fit is performed in terms of a direct product of \emph{Schmidt} basis,
also known as \emph{natural potentials}. These encode in a non-trivial way 
all the physics of the problem and, hence, circumvent the usual extra \emph{ad hoc} 
and \emph{a posteriori} adjustments (\emph{e.g.} damping functions) of the fitted PES.
Moreover, we avoid the intermediate \emph{refitting} stage common to other tensor-decomposition methods
typically used in the context of nuclear quantum dynamics.
The resulting SOP-FBR PES is analytical and differentiable \emph{ad inifinitum}.
Our \emph{ansatz} is fully general and can be used in combination with most (molecular) dynamics codes.
In particular, it has been interfaced and extensively tested with the Heidelberg implementation of the
Multiconfiguration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) quantum dynamical software package.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Major advances in the field of quantum dynamics have been connected to the introduction of novel \emph{ans\"atze} for the efficient 
representation of multidimensional objects, the wavefunction (WF) being 
 the most distinguished member of this category.
Indeed, a major breakthrough took place with the introduction of the 
Multiconfiguration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method\cite{bec00:1}.
In MCTDH the WF is represented by an efficient two-layer adaptive scheme consisting
on a time-dependent nuclear basis set expressed in terms of a time-independent one.
This allowed, for the first time, to overcome the traditional \emph{4-atom limit} of the so-called \emph{standard} method
when considering quantum dynamical problems using non-analytical potentials.
Perhaps, the most relevant change of paradigm arrived with the adoption of a multilayer (tree) formalism
epitomized by the Multilayer MCTDH (ML-MCTDH)\cite{wan03:1289,man08:164116,ven11:044135}
which was subsequently adopted by related methods such as the Gaussian variants of MCTDH.\cite{roe13:064106,ric15:269}
These compact and highly flexible multilayer-tree structures have allowed the implementation of
very efficient iterative\cite{phi18:064108} and recursive algorithms.\cite{ven11:044135,men18:126}
More recently, a new generation of promising methods in which the object structures belong to the
Tensor-Train family have appeared.\cite{bar15:174107,lar19:204102,gre17:4034,deg19:2780}

A common feature to all these methods is that they are particularly suited or
rely exclusively on Hamiltonian operators expressed in a separable form, the so-called sum-of-products (SOP) form,
such as the Vibronic Coupling model Hamiltonian. Considering the Kinetic Energy Operator, either
it is already in this form or it can be expressed either analytically\cite{gat98:8804} or numerically\cite{lau02:8560}
in SOP form in a \emph{quasi} automated fashion. On the other hand, the computation of
potential energy surfaces (PESs) still poses major challenges. For decades now,
major efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient tensor decomposition
 algorithms to turn these \emph{a priori} unstructured objects (multidimensional PES) 
 into separable form.\cite{jae96:7974,pel13:014108,sch17:064105,ott14:014106,ott18:116,pan19:576} 
A common feature to all these methods is that they rely on a two-step \emph{decoupled} scheme.
After the multidimensional fit of a set of \emph{ab initio} energies, the resulting PES is
tensor decomposed to achieve the sought separable form. An exception to this can, in a certain sense, be
found in the so-called \emph{on-the-fly} methods in which a more or less local (in configuration space) PES 
is obtained directly from electronic structure calculations.\cite{ric18:134116}\\

In this work, we shall introduce a scheme for the computation of a \emph{global} PESs
directly from electronic structure calculations in separable form,
more specifically, but by no means restricted to, the Tucker SOP form. 
The computation of a more or less \emph{global} high-dimensional PESs
is a laborious task involving the calculation of energies and possibly properties
in a large set of reference configurations, followed by the fit into an analytic expression.
The latter will be turned into a \emph{hopefully} efficient code which will be interfaced with or
directly implemented in a dynamics software package. Assuming the possibility of numerically converged dynamical
 calculations, one can conclude that two major factors will contribute
 to the quality of a simulation: (i) the accuracy and adequacy of the underlying electronic structure calculations
 (\emph{i.e.} combination of level of theory and electronic basis set); 
 (ii) the errors associated to the fitting procedure which, in turn, depend on the adequacy of the distribution of the reference geometries.
 In addition to this, as already mentioned above, the use of PES in combination 
 with grid-based quantum dynamical methods, like MCTDH,\cite{bec00:1}
 does greatly benefit from PESs expressed in SOP form.
Consequently, an extra tensor decomposition stage with its intrinsic error (see for instance Ref. \cite{pel13:014108})
should be added to this workflow.\\

There is a plethora of fitting procedures for PESs available, so we refer the reader to (part of) the original and extensive
literature.\cite{bra09:577, daw07:184108, san13:184302, fra11:8379, jia16:479, unk20:013001}
We will, however, turn our attention into methods which, by \emph{ansatz}, directly provide a SOP form (Eq.\ref{eq:sop}).
In this category, we can distinguish three types of methods: (i) those providing a
local (Taylor) expansion, typically Quartic Force Fields;\cite{bar05:014108,ram15:154118,bar17:arxiv} 
(ii) those using an appropriate Neural Network (NN) approach
(epitomized by the seminal work of Manzhos and Carrington\cite{man06:194105} and recent applications thereof)\cite{pra17:22272, jia14:034109}; 
and (iii) those directly fitting into a separable form (see for instance, \cite{ric12:224105,tho12:8628,ric14:1401,avi15:044106,bar15:174107,pan19:576,aer20:024305}) including
specific NN \emph{ans\"atze} which have been shown to be directly expressible in separable form.\cite{man06:194105,pra17:22272}
It is worth highlighting the efficient combination of a Smolyak quadrature 
with non-direct product basis achieved by \'Avila and Carrington.\cite{avi15:044106}
Perhaps, a more particular case of this last category is given by our recent method for global multidimensional fit of PES\cite{pan19:576}
in which an intermediate and inexpensive (yet chemically accurate) representation of 
the electronic Hamiltonian (a reparametrised semiempirical Hamiltonian) can be directly interfaced to a tensor decomposition method 
such as the Multigrid POTFIT algorithm,\cite{pel13:014108} hence the name of the method Specific Reaction Parameter Multigrid POTFIT (SRP-MGPF).\cite{pan19:576}
In this regard, the physically meaningful representation of the SRP Hamiltonian allows for the use a fairly small 
amount of reference points while, at the same time, it provides a physically correct PES.\cite{pan19:576}
The quality of this SRP PES has been assessed through the determination of accurate vibrational eigenstate
 and the propagation of a wavepacket using the MCTDH software.\\

As briefly sketched above, in (molecular) quantum dynamics (\emph{aka} multidimensional wavepacket propagations) 
arguably the main bottleneck is the computation and representation the potential energy surface (PES) in a suitable form.\cite{pel13:014108, pan19:576}
Turning our attention to MCTDH, a potentially numerically exact method, an already existing PES (in the form of a subroutine or an appropriate analytical function)
has to be preprocessed (tensor decomposed) in order to achieve the so-called sum-of-products (SOP) form representation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sop}
   V = \sum_r c_r \prod_\kappa v^{(\kappa)}_r
 \end{equation}
where the $v^{(\kappa)}$ are mono- (or low-dimensional) basis functions expressed on a grid (see Eq.\ref{eq:gridtucker}).
There are plenty different types of SOP forms (Tucker form, CP format, Tensor-Train decomposition or even the conceptually simple Taylor expansion, among others).
In this work, we shall focus on the so-called Tucker form (Eq.\ref{eq:gridtucker}) which is the most commonly used in MCTDH. The reader is referred to the abundant 
literature concerning the advantages of using SOP in general (curse of dimensionality, quadrature) and in MCTDH in particular
(see for instance the \emph{classical} MCTDH Review).\cite{bec00:1}
It should be stressed that the subsequent discussion is fully general and thus applicable to any type of multidimensional functions.
However, without any loss of generality, we shall make reference to aspects related to MCTDH quantum dynamics.\\

The different \emph{variational} Tucker decomposition schemes proposed over the years\cite{jae96:7974,pel13:014108,sch17:064105} have been shown to be efficient, accurate, and, 
most relevantly, they have been shown to allow a systematic control of the error owing to their variational character.
In all of these methods, the main goal is to compute an 
accurate representation of (or an approximation to) potential density matrices from which grid-based \emph{Schmidt} basis functions
(\emph{aka} single-particle potentials, natural potentials) can be extracted as eigenvectors.
The main difference in these methods is simply how they arrive to these density matrices.
For instance, in the pioneering POTFIT algorithm,\cite{jae96:7974} this was achieved by computing the potential on the whole grid (thence its power but limited applicability).
On the other hand, in Multigrid POTFIT,\cite{pel13:014108} this was achieved using a series of nested grids, whereas in the equivalent 
Monte-Carlo POTFIT,\cite{sch17:064105}
 the potential density matrices were stochastically approximated. For the sake of completeness, we should at this point mention
 the powerful strategies proposed by Otto\cite{ott14:014106, ott18:116} and Schr\"oder\cite{sch20:024108}
 in which the sought separable form is obtained through a series of (recursive) High-Order Singular Value Decompositions\cite{lat00:1253} 
 and a CANDECOMP\cite{car70:283, har70:1} formalism, respectively.
 In any case, the common requirement of all these approaches is the \emph{preexistence} of a PES in analytical form. 
 Consequently, they can be seen as \emph{refitting} methods.\\
 
In this work, we tackle this very problem under the assumption that it is possible to achieve a SOP form directly
from high-level electronic structure calculations. As it will be shown, this makes the computation of a global PES
more efficient and, what is more relevant, less prone to errors since this scheme reduces
the necessary number of stages to this end. As such, our sum-of-products Finite-Basis-Representation (SOP-FBR) 
approach, constitutes an alternative to some NN-based methods.\cite{man06:194105,pra17:22272}
The idea behind SOP-FBR is simple. Given a low-rank Tucker expansion on the grid,
we replace the grid-based basis functions (\emph{i.e.} natural potentials) by an expansion in 
terms a set of functions. As a result, a global SOP-FBR PES is simply an analytical expression 
in Tucker form (but not restricted to this specific form). The SOP-FBR parameters are obtained by
optimisation using an appropriate number of reference \emph{ab initio} energies.
A subtle difference between SOP-FBR and any traditional multivariate regression
method is the fact that we do not directly fit our PES to, say, a set of physically-oriented polynomials (\emph{one-layer}).
In SOP-FBR, we optimize a certain number of configuration interaction coefficients together with the
expansion coefficients necessary to expand optimal \emph{Schmidt} basis (\emph{i.e.} natural potentials)
in terms of a given set of functions (\emph{e.g.} orthonormal polynomials).
Consequently, SOP-FBR relies on a \emph{two-layer} scheme, analogous (no time-dependence though)
to the MCTDH one in which the WF is represented by a time-dependent basis (upper layer)
and an underlying time-independent one (lower layer).
This scheme provides us with a highly flexible model relying on the \emph{optimal} properties of a multidimensional Schmidt decomposition
(see Appendix D in \cite{bec00:1} and Appendix B in \cite{pel13:014108}).

\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}
The \emph{traditional recipe} for the preparation of a PES suited for quantum dynamical calculations typically implies three/four steps:
\begin{itemize}
   \item[1.-]{the judicious choice of reference geometries;}
   \item[2.-]{the computation of accurate reference energies;}
   \item[3.-]{an analytical fit; and}
   \item[4.-]{(in certain cases) a tensor decomposition.}
\end{itemize}
With respect to step 1, we have recently shown that it is possible to automatically obtain an \emph{optimal} set of pivotal structures
 (based on the stationary points) from which systematically generate a set of reference geometries.\cite{pan19:576}
 On the other hand, from step 2, all stages imply a direct loss of quality in the resulting PES owing to: 
 (i) the intrinsic accuracy of the selected level of theory; 
(ii) the accuracy of the fit (dramatically dependent on the dimension of the system); and
(iii) the quality of the decomposition, which is directly related to the size of the resulting expansion and the quality of the basis functions.
To understand the last point, one should simply consider the vast configuration space associated to the parametrical
representation of the chosen tensor structure. In this respect, multiple minima are to be expected owing to the usual non-unique character of
a, for instance, Tucker decomposition.\cite{kol09:455}
Since our approach involves (but it is by no means limited to) Tucker expansions, in the following we shall use the terms SOP and Tucker 
exchangeably.\\ 

We propose to combine stages 3 and 4 in a single step thus, potentially (and effectively) reducing the number of steps involved in a PES fit
together with the concomitant errors. Obviously, electronic structure calculations are unavoidable, so far, but owing to the computer
power available (\emph{e.g.} supercomputer centers), this is not anymore a \emph{bottleneck}.
The basic idea is that it is possible to arrive to an \emph{optimal} SOP (Tucker) expression (\emph{i.e.} to the optimal parameters defining it)
either stochastically or by using some kind of, possibly global, optimization algorithm. In other words, a guess of initial SOP parameters will be optimised 
according to a suitably defined target function. In our case, this will be the root-mean square error (RMSE, $\chi(\mathbf{Q})$) 
between the reference function (\emph{exact}) and our current approximation to it (\emph{app}):
\begin{equation}
  \chi(\mathbf{Q})=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_i^N \Delta V_i^2(Q_i)}{N}}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta V_i=V^{exact}(Q_i)-V^{app}(Q_i)$ is the difference between the exact potential and the approximated one at the i-th reference geometry.
Ideally, the approximation should be such that when computing the RMSE using another (possibly denser) set of geometries ($\{\mathbf{Q'}\}$,
validation set) different from the reference one,
the RMSE remains reasonably close to the reference one: $|\chi(\mathbf{Q}) - \chi (\mathbf{Q'})|<\epsilon$ with $\epsilon$ small.\\

At this point, it should be emphasised that in contrast to grid-based tensor decomposition methods, in SOP-FBR we do not necessarily rely on a grid. The so-called single-particle (or natural) potentials of POTFIT (or related methods) are replaced by analytical functions which we refer to as \emph{Schmidt} functions. The latter are expanded in a given polynomial series (Chebyshev in our case). This results in a set of parameters (\emph{core} tensor and expansion coefficients) which are optimised in order to reproduce a given level of theory. To obtain a suitable guess for the optimisation process, we employ an initial (grid-based) Tucker decomposition using, for instance, the Higher Order Orthogonal Iteration (HOOI) algorithm as implemented in the \texttt{TensorLy} library. It should be stressed that this initial decomposition cannot be directly performed on the high-level PES (e.g. high-level ab initio) owing to the huge number of grid points needed and the necessary CPU time for this. This has been extensively discussed in our previous work on SRP-MGPF.\cite{pan19:576}\\

A low-rank $f$-dimensional grid-based expansion of the PES in Tucker form reads:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gridtucker}
   V^{app}_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_f} = \sum_{j_1}^{m_1}\cdots\sum^{m_f}_{j_f} C_{j_1,\ldots,j_f} \prod_\kappa^f v^{(\kappa)}_{i_\kappa j_\kappa}
\end{equation}
where $C_{j_1,\ldots,j_f}$ is a coefficient belonging to the so-called \emph{core} tensor and $v^{(\kappa)}$ are the \emph{Schmidt} basis functions
(factor matrices in the tensor community\cite{kho07:523}) expressed on a grid
(note the two indices).\cite{jae96:7974} The latter are referred to as single-particle potentials (SPPs) in the MCTDH literature.
 This is the \emph{ansatz} commonly used in POTFIT, MGPF or MCPF to represent the PES in SOP form.
In this expression, the PES value at a given geometry (V($\mathbf{Q}$), with $\mathbf{Q}\equiv \left(q_{i_1}, \ldots, q_{i_f} \right)$) specified by its grid indices
($ \left(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_f\right)\leftrightarrow \left(q_{i_1}, \ldots, q_{i_f} \right)$) is expressed as a sum of products
of weighing coefficients ($C_{j_1,\ldots,j_f} $) times a (Hartree) product of one- (or low-) dimensional functions on a grid ($v^{(\kappa)}_{i_\kappa j_\kappa}$).
Note that by $\kappa$ we refer to a given degree of freedom (DOF). In Figure \ref{fig:graphtucker}, we display the graphical representation of a
3-dimensional (3D) Tucker expansion. Note that the \emph{core}-tensor has the same dimensionality than the initial reference tensor of PES
 on the grid and thus it is affected by the curse of dimensionality at the same rate.
With respect to notation, the above Tucker expression can be more compactly written as (see Kolda and Bader's comprehensive review)\cite{kol09:455}:
\begin{equation}
   V^{app}=[\![\mathcal{C}, \mathbf{v}]\!]
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{center}
   \scalebox{0.25}{\includegraphics{figures/TensDecomp2}}
   \end{center}
   \caption{
    \small{Graphical representation of a 3D Tucker expansion. See main text for explanation.}}
    \label{fig:graphtucker}
\end{figure}

To motivate our discussion, we should recall that in the original POTFIT (and related methods), the SPPs are grid-based basis functions adopting the form of matrices. 
Hence the SPPs merely contain the collection of SPP values at the grid points.
Consequently, the existence of implicit \emph{underlying SPP/Schmidt functions} can be exploited in order to increase the density of the grid
representation of PES. In MCTDH, this is the so-called \texttt{chnpot} procedure in which some kind of interpolating
procedure (\emph{e.g.} cubic splines) is used to approximate SPPs values in the regions in between the original grid points.\cite{jae96:7974} 
The SPPs or Schmidt functions are smooth except perhaps for the large $j$ ones. To illustrate this, we present in Figure \ref{fig:natpots1} 
the first 10 SPPs of the water molecule (see details of the PES later in text) on a grid (dots) together with interpolating functions (lines). 
The SPPs have been obtained through the Higher Order Orthogonal Iteration (HOOI) method as implemented in the \texttt{TensorLy}
Python library.\cite{kos19:925} 
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \begin{center}
   \includegraphics[scale=.7]{figures/evec10_h2o.pdf}
  \end{center}
   \caption{
    \small{Representation of the first 10 natural potentials of the PJT2-PES of the H$_2$O molecule. 
    The dots represent the values of the natural potentials at the DVR grid points.}}
    \label{fig:natpots1}
\end{figure}

 As it can be observed, there is a remarkable smoothness in the lower-$j$ basis functions whereas the higher-$j$ SPPs exhibit a
 highly oscillating (somewhat noisy) and, hence, undesirable trend for fitting.
 At this point, it should be further emphasised that these lower-j Schmidt basis carry the most relevant information of the PES 
 as proven by the fact that grid-based methods such as MGPF or MCPF only require such a small amount of SPPs.
 The behaviour of the SPPs was already discussed in the seminal POTFIT paper by J\"ackle and Meyer\cite{jae96:7974}
 as well as by Manzhos and Carrington.\cite{man06:084109} Interestingly, this important property has not been fully exploited and lies at the core of our approach.
Based on this simple observation, we propose a new low-rank \emph{ansatz} in which we substitute the SOP grid-based expression (Eq.\ref{eq:gridtucker})
by a SOP Finite Basis Representation (SOP-FBR) in terms of some basis functions ($T(q)$):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sopfbr}
   V(q_1,\ldots,q_f) = \sum_{j_1}^{m_1}\cdots\sum^{m_f}_{j_f} C_{j_1,\ldots,j_f} \prod_\kappa^f (\sum^{t_\kappa}_\mu c^{(\kappa)}_{\mu, j_\kappa} T_\mu(q_\kappa))
\end{equation}
where the the grid indices ($i_\kappa$) in Eq.\ref{eq:gridtucker} have been replaced by the value of the actual coordinate ($q_\kappa$).
This expression can be used in any grid since the grid-based SPPs ($v^{(\kappa)}$) are now interpolated through the
use of a weighted sum of $t_\kappa$ $T$-basis functions:
\begin{equation}
   v^{(\kappa)}_j (q_\kappa) =  \sum^{t_\kappa}_\mu c^{(\kappa)}_{\mu, j_\kappa} T_\mu(q_\kappa)
\end{equation}
with $T$ assumed to be appropriated for the specific problem.
The case we discuss is that of a general molecular PES (multiwell bound region) for which the typical 
behaviour is that of the SPPs in Figure 2. However, we have observed that the higher-j SPPs for the Coulomb potential present a 
convoluted sinus type behaviour (work in progress).
Throughout this work we have expressed $T$ with Chebyshev polynomials but any other functions are also possible.
Consequently, this change in the representation, from grid to FBR,
leads to a full analytical global PES, grid-independent and differentiable \emph{ad infinitum}. Indeed, one can immediately realise
 that n-th order derivatives can be obtained in a straightforward manner. By direct differentiation, one obtains:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sopfbrderiv}
\frac{\partial ^nV (q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_f)}{\partial q_\kappa^n} = \sum_{j_1}^{m_1}\cdots\sum^{m_f}_{j_f} C_{j_1,\ldots,j_f} 
  \left(\sum^{t_\kappa}_\mu c^{(\kappa)}_{\mu, j_\kappa}  \frac{\partial^n T_\mu(q_\kappa)}{\partial q_\kappa^n}\right)
  \prod_{\nu\ne \kappa}^f \left(\sum^{t_\nu}_\mu c^{(\nu)}_{\mu, j_\nu}  T_\mu(q_\nu)\right)
\end{equation}
At this point it is convenient to highlight some analogies between low-rank grid based methods, such as grid-based MGPF and grid-free SOP-FBR.
In the original publication\cite{pel13:014108} and subsequent applications,\cite{pel14:42,pel17:100,hal19:14754} it could be observed that 
MGPF is able to extract a very compact representation of the PES following a given prescription in the choice of the reference points 
(see discussion on the sparsity of the \emph{core} tensor in Section \ref{sect2}).
For instance, in Ref.\cite{pel17:100}, the infrared spectrum of H$_3$O$_2^-$ (9D) was computed.
The MGPF PES required 1.7 MB of storage. In contrast, the original PES which would have required 10$^5$ MB. 
The resulting MGPF PES based spectrum was in good agreement with the reference experimental Ar-vibrational predissociation one.
 In view of the nice agreement, discrepancies between both spectra could be attributed to the effect of the Ar atom in the 
 vibrational structure of the H$_3$O$_2^-$ complex.
In other words, considering the PES as a multidimensional image, it is possible to compress it using just a few basis functions.
The difference in SOP-FBR is only that we achieve the same expansion through an extra parametrization of the SPP (Schmidt functions) and an optimisation.
In summary, it is possible to obtain such an $\mathcal{L}^2$-optimal Tucker expansion using numerical methods such as stochastic, global, local search algorithms
or a suitable combination thereof. 

To finalize this Section, for the MCTDH oriented reader, we would like to point out that the \emph{contracted} mode ($\nu$):\cite{jae96:7974}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gridcontr}
    D^{(\nu)}_{j_1 \ldots i_\nu \ldots j_f} = \sum_{j_\nu} C_{j_1 \ldots j_\nu \ldots j_f} v^{(\nu)}_{i_\nu j_\nu}
\end{equation}
can be readily obtained from a SOP-FBR expression through:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sopcontr}
     D^{(\nu)}_{j_1\ldots i_\nu\ldots j_f} = \sum_{j_\nu} C_{j_1\ldots j_\nu\ldots j_f} v^{(\nu)}_{j_\nu} (q^{(\nu)}_{i_\nu})
\end{equation}
provided that a large enough sampling has been considered for the contracted mode (\emph{cf.} torsion mode in HONO in Section \ref{sect2}).\\

\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec:results}

In this Section, we shall introduce and discuss the actual implementation of the method as well as the computational and numerical properties of the SOP-FBR PES.
Hereafter, the following notation for our SOP-FBR expansions will be used: $[(m_1, t_1), (m_2, t_2), (m_3, t_3),...]$
 representing an $f$-dimensional \emph{core} tensor possessing $\prod_\kappa^f m_\kappa$ elements.
This also indicates that each $\kappa$ DOF is given by a set of $m_\kappa$ basis functions which, in turn, 
are expressed in terms of $t_\kappa$ underlying basis, in the present case, Chebyshev polynomials.
It should be further emphasized that there is no restriction in the type of basis sets 
employed, except that it should be adapted to the target potential.
The total number of parameters will formally then be: $\prod_\kappa^f m_\kappa + \sum_\kappa^f m_\kappa\cdot t_\kappa$.
As it will be discussed, we will profit from the huge range of values (over 12 orders of magnitude) among the \emph{core} tensor elements to greatly
reduce the number $\prod_\kappa^f m_\kappa$ terms.
Finally, in those cases where $d$ DOF are represented by the same amount of basis functions, we shall simply write $[d \times (m, t)]$.
Note that the Chebyshev polynomials start at order 0, hence $(m, t)$ implies the use of a Chebyshev polynomial of maximum order $(t-1)$.


\subsection{Proof of concept: SOP-FBR of a Henon-Heiles potential (3D and 9D)}\label{subsec:bh}
In order to test our algorithm and assess its quality, we have studied the celebrated Henon-Heiles potential which 
constitutes a common potential benchmark\cite{nes02:10499, ven11:044135} of low-rank character:
\begin{equation}\label{fig:hhpot}
  V = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\kappa=1}^f q^2_\kappa + \lambda\sum_{\kappa=1}^{f-1}\left(q^2_\kappa q_{\kappa + 1}-\frac{1}{3}q^3_{\kappa+1}\right) 
  \quad \text{$\lambda$=0.111803}
\end{equation}
In our case, the choice of the anharmonic parameter ($\lambda$) has been based on purely \emph{historic} reasons.\cite{nes02:10499, ven11:044135}
The potential boundaries are [-9, 7] length units.\cite{ven11:044135}
The study of a low-rank expression serves as both a proof of concept for our algorithm as well as
a validation for the numerical accuracy of our approach.
Indeed, as shown in Reference \cite{pel13:014108} for the MGPF tensor decomposition algorithm,
we should expect SOP-FBR to be able to exactly describe low-rank potentials. In other words,  it should be possible to obtain,
 in a non-algebraic manner, an accurate approximation to the optimal \emph{core} tensor coefficients
as well as the values of the Schmidt factor matrices (\emph{aka} single-particle potentials, SPPs) through 
a \emph{walk} through the configuration space of the SOP-FBR parameters.\\

First of all, to illustrate the idea of sampling the Tucker configuration space, we have considered the stochastical optimisation of a
SOP-FBR ( $[3\times(6,5)]$) for a 3D Henon-Heiles potential (Eq.\ref{fig:hhpot} with $f=3$) (boundaries as previously indicated).
For this we have used the robust Basin-Hopping (BH) global optimisation algorithm\cite{wal97:5111} as implemented in the \texttt{SciPy} library.\cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}
The initial guess parameters have been obtained through random sampling in the intervals [0., 0.01] and [-1.0,1.0] for the \emph{core} and Chebyshev polynomials coefficients, respectively.\
A systematic strategy for the computation of this guess will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:h2o}.
The obtained RMSE error has been of $2.076\cdot10^{-5}$
 
This result nicely illustrates the \emph{possibility} of strolling along (or guiding our algorithm through) the Tucker configuration space to find minima.
In the following, we shall introduce a more educated procedure to generate the set of initial guess parameters and to search for the RMSE minimum.\\

We continue now with same very same type of potential, Henon-Heiles for 3D (again $[3\times(6,5)]$) and for 9D ($[9\times(6,7)]$ ).
In this case, we employ a more educated guess consisting in values randomly chosen from a Gaussian distribution around
HOOI values (see discussion about the SOP-FBR guess in Section \ref{subsec:guess})
This time, however, we shall make use of a local optimiser, more specifically, the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm\cite{noc06}
as implemented in the \texttt{SciPy} library.\cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}. We do this in a decoupled manner.
We first optimize the basis functions (Chebyshev) coefficients
(leaving the \emph{core} tensor fixed) and then we optimise the \emph{core} tensor elements (leaving the Chebyshev coefficients fixed).
The simple idea behind this is the reduction of computational cost when dealing with large dimensional problems.
In Table \ref{tab:rmseHH}, we present the RMSE errors obtained for these two optimisations. As it can be observed, in both cases
the error can be assimilated to purely numerical noise thus validating our approach and, more relevantly at this stage, our algorithm.

To further analyse the characteristics of our SOP-FBRs, in Figure \ref{fig:hh3d}, 
we present contour plots (x=0) of the HH 3D reference potential, the SOP-FBR approximation, and the $\mathcal{L}_1$ difference between them.
As it can be seen, the error (~10$^{-13}$) is homogeneously distributed along all energy domains. This can also be observed for the 9D case
in the graph of the energy correlation comparing the reference potential and our SOP-FBR approximation (Fig.\ref{fig:hh9d}),
in which latter follows closely the former without any appreciable divergence within the whole energy interval.
The 3D(9D) SOP-FBR optimisation required 0.27(0.35) hours of CPU using 24 processors.

\section{SOP-FBR of a low-dimensionality PES: H$_2$O (3D)}\label{sec:h2o}

In the following section, we shall tackle a \emph{realistic} 3D problem, the water (H$_2$O) molecule.
We have used the Polyanski-Jensen-Tennyson H$_2^{16}$O spectroscopically refined PES known as PJT2.\cite{pol96:6490}

\subsection{Generation of the guess parameters}\label{subsec:guess}

In contrast to our previous model case-study, the HH potential, when dealing with \emph{ab initio} PES, 
it would be desirable, for the sake of efficiency, to start our calculation with a physically oriented guess. 
Our strategy for this has consisted in the use of an inexpensive SRP PES computed \emph{a priori} following our recently published
method\cite{pan19:576} using our own software (SRPTucker\cite{pan19}) which is interfaced with the MOPAC semiempirical software.\cite{ste16}
This SRP PES can be readily decomposed on a grid using the High Order Orthogonal Iteration (HOOI) algorithm\cite{kol09:455}
 thus obtaining an initial \emph{core} tensor and its associated Schmidt basis functions (SPPs).
In this particular SRP PES, we utilised a grid  of $5^3$ reference geometries (a subset of the one that we use for the SOP-FBR optimisation)
 and made use of the Parametric Model 3 (PM3) Hamiltonian.\cite{ste13:1}
 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/spps_h2o_comp_labelfix.png}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/evec_hono_1.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{First five SPPs of the angular DOF ($\theta_{HOH}$) for the H$_2$O molecule obtained by HOOI Tucker decomposition using 
	(i) the reference potential PJT2\cite{pol96:6490} (blue) (ii) the PM3 Hamiltonian (orange); and (iii) the resulting SRP (green).}\label{spps_h2o_srp_pm3}
\end{figure}
 
 Figure~\ref{spps_h2o_srp_pm3} displays a comparison of the first five SRP SPPs 
 for the \textit{ab initio} reference surface, the PM3 surface, and the resulting SRP\@.
 As it can be observed, the guess SRP SPPs are in much better agreement with the \emph{exact} ones than the original PM3.
 From these plots, we notice that the SRP constitutes a better source of guess parameters than the PM3 method. Despite the fact that
 we are dealing with guess (initial) Schmidt functions (SPPs), any improvement in the shape of the semiempirical SPPs will be turned into
 a saving in computational effort when searching for the optimal SOP-FBR solution. On the other hand, the most relevant elements 
 of the \emph{core} tensor are very similar for the three methods (see Figure~\ref{compare_core_h2o}).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/compare_core_h2o.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Comparison of the first elements of the \emph{core} tensor of the H$_2$O molecule obtained by HOOI Tucker decomposition of (i) the reference potential\cite{pol96:6490} (ii) the PM3 hamiltonian and (iii) the corresponding SRP\@. Since the \emph{core} tensor happens to be very sparse, for higher index values the differences are even less appreciable.}\label{compare_core_h2o}
\end{figure}

For the sake of efficiency, prior to any optimisation, we have imposed a symmetrization by \emph{ansatz} to the SOP-FBR expression:
(i) the SPPs for both $OH$ stretching modes have been forced to be equal, and (ii) the \emph{core} tensor elements satisfy the $C_{ijk} = C_{jik}$ condition, 
where $ijk$ are indices referring to Schmidt basis functions (SPPs) and we have implicitly assumed the $[r_1\equiv\nu_{OH1}, r_2\equiv\nu_{OH2}, \theta_{HOH}]$ mode ordering.
It should be noticed that if no such restriction is imposed, the obtained SPPs are nevertheless reasonably close to the symmetrized ones.\\

The SOP-FBR optimisation has been performed in a \emph{decoupled} manner (see discussion in Section \ref{subsec:bh}) using
a combination of global and local algorithms, namely Multi-Level Single-Linkage (MLSL)\cite{kan87:39} for the former
and Bound Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation (BOBYQA) for the latter.\cite{pow09:26} This type of
approaches have been shown to be very well adapted to the reparametrisation of semiempirical Hamitonians.\cite{pan19:576}
For this optimisation, we used a set (grid) of [15, 15, 15] structures (mode ordering as above) and the SOP-FBR structure was
 $[3\times(5,11)]$ thus generating a parameter space of size $5^3 + 3 \cdot 5 \cdot11 = 290$.  The reference points were generated 
through homogeneous sampling of normal distributions centred at the water molecule equilibrium parameters.
We used for this the \texttt{truncnorm} method of SciPy.\cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}
The standard deviation was set up in order to cover the 1D intervals taken from the MCTDH model inputs,
which are available in the Heidelberg MCTDH software package (see Table \ref{tab:dvrh2o}).
It should be stressed that equilibrium geometrical parameters can be computed through the use of automated
methods (see for instance Ref.\cite{kop19:e26008} and references therein).\\
 
 \begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Correlation plot between the reference \emph{ab initio} energies and corresponding SOP-FBR energies, and cumulative RMSE values obtained with a reference tensor of $15\times15\times15$ points.}\label{fig_h2o_an}
\end{figure}
 
The resulting SOP-FBR RMSE was of 0.686 $cm^{-1}$, a value which was nicely preserved (0.703 $cm^{-1}$) when considering a
validation set of $10^6$ points, different from the reference ones. It should be noted that similar errors have been obtained with larger sets,
all converging to the reference value (HOOI decomposition) of RMSE = 0.673 $cm^{-1}$.
The quality of the resulting SOP-FBR PES has been assessed in several different ways. In Figure ~\ref{fig_h2o_an}, 
we present a graphical analysis of its quality in the form of a correlation plot between the reference and SOP-FBR energies (left panel) 
and the cumulative RMSE (right panel). As it can be observed, the error is equally distributed along the whole energy interval [0, 40000] cm$^{-1}$.
Moreover, we have computed the minimum of the PES using the steepest descent method. The SOP-FBR and reference values
(see Table~\ref{myta01}) agree up to the fourth decimal place. 

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Minimum geometrical parameters for the reference PES and the SOP-FBR PES obtained with the steepest descent algorithm.

SOP-FBR & 1.8102 & 1.8102 & 1.8240 \\ %\midrule
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As final test of the quality of the SOP-FBR PES, we have computed the Zero Point Energy (ZPE) and lowest vibrational eigenvalues with the
MCTDH algorithm. For this problem, we have considered the Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) shown in Table \ref{tab:dvrh2o}.

Our results are in very nice agreement with the reference PES. Our ZPE is of 4660.225 cm$^{-1}$, a value
which nicely compares to the reference one of 4660.124 cm$^{-1}$. 
The remaining vibrational eigenvalues (relative to the ZPE) are presented in Table \ref{tab:vibeigsth2o}. In all cases, the differences
between the SOP-FBR and the reference values is below 1 cm$^{-1}$.

\section{Six dimensional case: HONO isomerization}\label{sect2}
As final example, we study now the HONO (6D) PES in the \emph{cis-trans} isomerization region which has become a
benchmark for these type of methodological studies.\cite{pra17:22272, bar15:174107, pan19:576}
In this case the reference PES is given by the model CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ-quality analytical PES of Richter \emph{et al.}\cite{ric04:1306}
The structure of our 6D SOP-FBR PES is given by $[5\times(5,7),(12,12)]$, that is, 5 Schmidt basis (SPPs) represented by 7 Chebyshev polynomials each,
for all DOF except the torsion which necessitates a somewhat larger basis (\emph{i.e.} sampling) of 12 Schmidt basis (SPPs) 
represented by 12 Chebyshev polynomials each (up to 11th order).

For the SOP-FBR (decoupled) optimisation, we have used the BFGS algorithm in combination with a set of 37500 reference geometries, 
mapped onto a [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 12] Cartesian product grid of reference energies. The DOF ordering is [$r_{OH}, r_{NO}, u_2, r_{ON}, u_1, \phi$] (see Table \ref{tab:dvrhono}). 
The intervals of definition of the different DOF can be found in Table \ref{tab:dvrhono}). 
For the sake of comparison, we have defined $u_i$ = cos $\theta_i$ (i=1,2) as in previous studies.\cite{ric04:1306, pan19:576}

Our strategy to initialize our SOP-FBR optimisation has consisted again in generating a guess \emph{core} tensor and the associated set of SPPs using  
the HOOI decomposition (same structure of our target SOP-FBR) using a SRP PES.
For the latter, we have chosen the so-called $\{\zeta_{1084}\}$ set of SRP-parameters which we
generated for the title system and which showed an accurate vibrational structure (see Ref. \cite{pan19:576} for more details).
In Figure~\ref{hono_spps}, we display a comparison of the first four SPPs for selected DOF (a distance, an angle, and the torsion),
$r_{NO}$, $u_1$ and $\phi$, respectively. As in the case of water, the SRP SPPs are closer to the reference ones, in turn, leading to a higher efficiency in the SOP-FBR optimisation.

\end{figure}

At this point, we make use of the particular distribution of values within the \emph{core} tensor. The latter 
could be understood to play a role analogous to that of configuration interaction coefficients in electronic structure.
First of all, it should be noticed that these values span a huge energy interval from 10$^7$ down to 10$^{-6}$ (values in cm$-1$).
The maximum corresponds to 22646896 cm$-1$ and 6940 cm$-1$ is the mean value.
Second, a large fraction of the total number of coefficients lies between $[10^{-2},10^{-3}]$ and almost 
the half of them lie below 10$^{-2}$. Considering this particular distribution and this huge span of values,
we can safely consider consider the \emph{core} tensor as being \emph{effectively} sparse. 
In other words, the relative weight of a large fraction of the configurations is negligible.
We can profit from this fact and assign zero value to all the elements below a certain threshold.
This, in turn, implies a dramatic reduction in the dimension of the SOP-FBR configuration space, 
thus leading to a higher efficiency and a more compact SOP-FBR final expression.\\

To carefully assess the quality of our SOP-FBR PES, we have used a validation set consisting on 10$^6$ points
generated in the form of a grid within the same boundaries as our reference but much denser.
In addition to this, in order to assess/identify possible errors associated to the SOP-FBR form, we have performed
an extra set of calculations using directly the HOOI decomposition of the original PES and
having it transformed into SOP-FBR form (Chebyshev expansion of the basis).\\

The SOP-FBR RMSE was 7.22 $cm^{-1}$, a satisfactory value somewhat larger than the one obtained for HOOI (2.93  $cm^{-1}$).
The former value should be understood in the context of a direct fit from \emph{ab initio} points, that is, it should be compared
to the RMSE obtained for the reference PES of about 5 cm$^{-1}$.\cite{ric04:1306}
The reliability of the SOP-FBR has been also assessed with a validation set consisting in $10^6$ points
for which we obtained an RMSE of 11.85 $cm^{-1}$. Analogously, the same calculation for the HOOI yielded a value of 4.20 $cm^{-1}$.
It should be noticed that the ratio between the RMSEs in the validation and reference sets is about 1.5 for both SOP-FBR and HOOI. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_hono_an_b}, we provide a graphical representation for these calculations.
It can be observed that for the whole range of fitted energies [0, 100000] cm$^{-1}$
a nice agreement between the reference and SOP-FBR values is obtained. At this point,
it should highlighted that we have tackled a range of energies ten times higher than previous studies dealing with the same system.\cite{pra17:22272}
The SOP-FBR optimisation required 0.37 hours of CPU using 12 processors.\\

As an extra test of quality, we have also characterised the stationary points of the SOP-FBR PES.
For this, we have computed the \emph{cis} and \emph{trans} minima as well as the corresponding transition state
using a steepest descent algorithm in reduced dimensionality: we have enforced the torsion angle at the
corresponding reference value, optimise the remaining coordinates and assess the resulting gradient. In all cases, the
maximum value of the gradient did not exceed 10$^{-7}$ units. The resulting geometrical parameters are presented in Table~\ref{myta02}.
As in the case of the water molecule, we obtain values that agree up to the fourth decimal place for both distances and angles.

The reliability of our SOP-FBR can be further illustrated by noticing its \emph{variational} behaviour. 
In Table \ref{tab:compPF}, we present the RMSE computed on the reference primitive grid (Table \ref{tab:dvrhono}) 
for trimmed SOP-FBR expansions (\emph{cf.} td-MGPF \cite{pel13:014108})
As it can be observed, 
the results compare well (and even improve) those of POTFIT (from Table IV in Ref. \cite{pel13:014108})
thus confirming the possibility of numerically \emph{strolling} towards different
(and sometimes more favourable) minima than POTFIT (or HOOI) in Tucker configuration space.

As definitive test of the quality of our SOP-FBR PES, we have computed its ZPE and the 20 lowest vibrationally excited eigenvalues.
With respect to the ZPE, our value is of 4366.7 cm$^{-1}$ which nicely compares to the reference one of 4367.7 cm$^{-1}$
and fully agrees with the HOOI one (4365.5 cm$^{-1}$). In Table \ref{tab:vibeigsthono}, we provide a comparison of the 
results for SOP-FBR, HOOI and the reference PES (exact). As it can be observed, there is a nice agreement among the three sets.
There is slight misestimate (common to both SOP-FBR and HOOI) of certain eigenvalues associated to the \emph{cis} well,\cite{ric04:1306}
whose origin can safely attributed to the sampling of this particular region.

\section{Conclusions}

We have presented sum-of-products Finite Basis Representation (SOP-FBR), an algorithm that
yields a PES in Tucker form directly from a set of reference \emph{ab initio} points.
In SOP-FBR, the Schmidt basis (\emph{aka} SPPs in the MCTDH literature) are expressed in
terms of a weighted sum of orthonormal polynomials. The Schmidt basis are universal for the same
type of PES and enclose in a non-evident way the topography of the PES (correlation among different DOF).  
The SOP-FBR expression is analytical and differentiable \emph{ad infinitum} and as such, SOP-FBR  
is ideally suited for its use in (classical or semi-classical) dynamical simulations.
More specifically, SOP-FBR allows for a seamlessly
interfacing with quantum dynamical codes such as MCTDH\cite{mctdh:package} or Quantics.\cite{quantics:package}
We have shown that the SOP-FBR can be straightforwardly symmetrized by \emph{ansatz} thus
diminishing the computational cost of the algorithm. In addition to this, we have 
also profited from the sparse character of the Tucker \emph{core} tensors.
The quality and smoothness of the SOP-FBR PES has been extensively benchmarked against reference potentials
(both model and high-level \emph{ab initio} PES) by carefully analysing the different errors 
(RMSE, correlation plots, cumulative RMSE) as well as by
comparing the resulting vibrational eigenvalues of each PES.
We have observed that SOP-FBR can lead to Tucker expansions
which are \emph{more optimal} than those obtained by an equivalent POTFIT (or related methods).
The current (beta) version of the SOP-FBR code has been written in Python 3.8.5 and will be freely distributed upon request.
The implementation has been interfaced with the Heidelberg MCTDH software package.\cite{mctdh:package} 

\section{Supplementary Material}

The full list of coefficients corresponding to the SOP-FBR PES for H$_2$O and HONO are available 
in the Supplementary Material file. Energies are given in cm$^{-1}$. In each list, the first two lines present
(1) the core dimensions (same as the number of DOF) and
(2) the number of Chebyshev functions per dimension, respectively. The rest of the lines present
the Chebyshev expansion coefficients and the core tensor elements in a 
column-major (colexicographic) ordering.
